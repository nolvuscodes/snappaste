**Introduction:** SnapPaste is a user-friendly desktop application designed to enhance the process of capturing and sharing screenshots. SnapPaste simplifies the workflow by seamlessly capturing screenshots, uploading them to Imgur, and generating shareable links for effortless sharing, all while being intuitive and efficient.

**Key Features:**

1.  **Hotkey Trigger:** SnapPaste leverages the WINDOWS + SHIFT + S hotkey combination to initiate the screenshot capture process. This familiar shortcut makes it convenient for users to capture the region of their choice quickly.
    
2.  **Clipboard Integration:** Upon selecting a screenshot region, SnapPaste automatically places the captured image onto the system clipboard. This functionality ensures that the user's captured content is readily available for sharing.
    
3.  **Imgur Integration:** SnapPaste seamlessly interfaces with Imgur, a popular image hosting service, to upload the captured screenshot. Imgur offers a reliable and accessible platform for image storage.
    
4.  **Shareable Links:** After successfully uploading the screenshot to Imgur, SnapPaste generates a shareable link to the uploaded image. This link is then presented to the user, allowing for effortless sharing with others.
    

**User Workflow:**
